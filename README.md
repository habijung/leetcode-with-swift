# LeetCode with Swift

## How to Test?

### Run all tests

- **Command**: Product ‣ **Test**
- **Key**: **⌘ + U** (Command + U)

### Run tests for each file

You need to activate any test or all tests first.  
**I recommand this if the key is changed to ⌥ + G**.

- **Command**: Product ‣ Perform Action ‣ **Test Again**
- **Key**: **⌃ ⌥ ⌘ + G** (Control + Option + Command + G)

### Run tests for current test with cursor

This command is activated when the cursor is in test code only.

- **Command**: Product ‣ Perform Action ‣ **Test Selected Items**
- **Key**: **⌃ ⌥ ⌘ + U** (Control + Option + Command + U)
